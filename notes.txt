If you don’t have a .htaccess file yet, you can create a file using the File Manager with the file name .htaccess. Using the File Manager is recommended, some systems (especially Windows) don’t work well with .htaccess files.
After you’ve found or created your .htaccess file, you can edit it in the File Manager or using any text editor (like Notepad). You need to add the following lines to the file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteCond %{HTTP:CF-Visitor} !{"scheme":"https"}
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
